# CodeQL for Visual Studio
This repository contains [binary releases](https://github.com/Semmle/visualstudio-codeql-binaries/releases) of the Visual Studio extension for writing CodeQL queries. **Note: the use of CodeQL for Visual Studio requires a separate license agreement with GitHub**

For more information on how to use this product, please refer to [the online help](https://help.semmle.com/ql-for-vs/Content/WebHelp/home-page.html).

This plugin is designed to work with [Microsoft Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (not Visual Studio Code). If you want to write and run CodeQL queries from Visual Studio Code, you can download the CodeQL extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=github.vscode-codeql).
